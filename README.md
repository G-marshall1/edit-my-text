# edit-my-text

## Description

I wanted to create an application that will allow me to make detailed notes both on and offline if I so choose. I decided to make this text editor becuase I wanted to challenge my knowledge on what a AWP is  and how service works opperate. I was able to successfully deploy this to render as an option for anyone to use or learn from.
